# Improving Emergency Services Performance for City of Cary, NC 

In this project, I built a cool visualization using Tableau to capture the current status quo and provide recommendations to help improve the efficiency and efficacy of the Police and Fire Department at Cary, NC through resource management.

I published a visualization for this project on my Tableau Public account. You can check it here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/danny.zhu#!/

The data is obtained from the following website:
https://data.townofcary.org/explore/dataset/cpd-incidents/information/?disjunctive.crime_category&disjunctive.crime_type&disjunctive.crimeday&disjunctive.district&disjunctive.offensecategory&disjunctive.violentproperty&disjunctive.total_incidents
which is publicly available data from the Cary government data resources.

The data for this project consists of two parts: police department data and fire department data. Each of them includes the specific information of each incident in the past 20 years.

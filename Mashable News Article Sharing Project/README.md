# Increasing News Article Sharing on Mashable 
In this project, I analyzed the popularity (number of shares) of online news on Mashable. 
This project belongs to the media & entertainment industry, and I specifically chose the online news industry as it is booming and readers are turning more towards online media instead of traditional paper media.

The dataset is obtained from the following website:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity
which is publicly available data from the UCI machine learning repository. 
This ensured the reliability of the data used for the analysis. 
This dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable News in a period of two years (Fernandes, et al., 2015). The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks which indicates the popularity of news.

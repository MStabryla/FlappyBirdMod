# Evaluating Market Demand for Smart Pen

In this project, I analyzed the reviews and ratings for Smartpen products listed on Amazon, created charts to visualize the market, and evaluated the market potential. 

I also built functions that could be used to extract information for different products. If you are interested in exploring other products, please feel free to use these functions to retrieve the data of the products you like.

The dataset is obtained from the following website: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ which is publicly available data from the UCSD  professor Julian McAuley's repository. This ensured the reliability of the data used for the analysis. This dataset summarizes the information of over 600K office and electronic products listed on Amazon and the over 9 million customer ratings and reviews of these products.
